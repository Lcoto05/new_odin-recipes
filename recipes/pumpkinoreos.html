    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 cupcake pans with liners.</li>
        <li>Prepare crusts: Mix Oreo crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, and salt together in a small bowl until combined. Place 1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of about 16 cupcake liners and press into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake crusts in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven; allow to cool. Do not turn oven off.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare cupcakes: Beat butter, vegetable oil, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and beat for 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add pumpkin and sour cream and mix until combined. Add cake flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, baking soda, cloves, and allspice and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the pumpkin batter over each Oreo crust.</li>
        <li>Bake cupcakes until tops spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 28 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For frosting, beat butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in cream cheese until thoroughly smooth and combined. Beat in 1 cup powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt until thoroughly combined, then beat in finely ground Oreos and black cocoa. Add in remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar; beat until smooth and combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in heavy cream, and mix on low speed. Gradually turn mixer speed up to medium-high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Frost cooled cupcakes as desired and top with an additional Oreo cookie, if desired.</li>
